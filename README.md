# Steam-Deck-AutoCache
A small script that allows to automatically move the cache on the SD card but only the caches of the games installed on it which allows to save space on the internal storage without having the problem of not being able to launch the games by changing the SD card,  it is just necessary to restart the script when a new game is installed
